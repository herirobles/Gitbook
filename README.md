# Issue description

Have a customer having issues configuring the API to get Security logs.

&#x20;Know why the logs were not being delivered properly.

Start investigating, reading, and asking. Talked with a senior member (creating an escalation with what I found).

&#x20;Understanding a lot about the API, being able to test not only this API but others, and being able to pass that knowledge to my team via a training
